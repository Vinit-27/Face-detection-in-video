# Face-detection-in-video

## Overview

This project is an efficient face detection and recognition system using FastMTCNN and facenet-pytorch, leveraging MTCNN for real-time face detection and InceptionResnetV1 for accurate face recognition. We implemented a custom class to optimize detection by processing frames with configurable stride and resizing, resulting in reduced computational overhead. The system utilizes PyTorch for GPU-accelerated computations, OpenCV for video frame handling, and TensorBoard for monitoring. It processes video frames, detects faces, extracts embeddings, and matches them against a pre-stored database, annotating recognized faces in the output video. This project demonstrates expertise in deep learning, computer vision, and real-time video processing.
